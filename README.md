# CST-401 Lecture Notes

Welcome to the repository for my CST-401 lecture notes!

## Purpose

This repository is dedicated to updating and maintaining my lecture notes for the CST-401 course. As I receive the lectures, I will first memorize the material and then write down my notes here.

## Notes Update Process

1. **Receive Lectures**: I attend the lectures and obtain the lecture materials.
2. **Memorize**: I spend time memorizing and understanding the lecture content thoroughly.
3. **Write Down Notes**: After I have a good grasp of the lecture material, I will write down my notes and update this repository.

## Structure

The repository will be organized into different folders based on the lecture topics and weeks. Each folder will contain the notes for a specific lecture.
