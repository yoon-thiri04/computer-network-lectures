# IP Addressing and Subnetting

Use Ip addresses and subnets to identify **Source and Destination** of Communication

IP Address
- Network Identifier => Aread of the network where a device resides **Area Code** 
- Host Identifier => A specific device in that network section


### Subnet masks clarify which part of the address is the network ID and which is the host ID. Routers, computers and network troubleshooters use IP addresses and subnet masks to manage network traffic, which ensures information sent from one system arrives at its destination.
