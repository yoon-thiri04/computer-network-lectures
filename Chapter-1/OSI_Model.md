## OSI Model

💡International Standard Organisation(`ISO`) is a multinational body dedicated to the world wide agreement on international standard.

💡The ISO standard that covers all aspects of the network communications is the **`Open System Interconnections (OSI)`** model

💡ISO is the organization, OSI is a model. OSI model is not a protocol, it is a model for understanding and designing a network architecture.

💡The OSI model is a layered framework for the design of network systems that allow communications between all types of computer system.

## Layered Architecture
### Layer-to-layer Communication
> 💻 Device A sends a message to the device B. (through intermediate nodes)

> 💻 At the sending site, the message is moved down from layer7 to layer1.

> 💻 At layer1, the entire package is converted to the form that can be transferred to the receiving site.

> 💻 At the receiving site, the message is moved up from layer1 to layer7.

### Encapsulation
> 🔗 The process starts at layer7( the application layer) and then moves from layer to layer in descending, sequential order.

> 🔗 At each layer, a header can be added to the data unit. At layer2, a trailer may also be added and then pass into physical layer (layer1).

> 🔗 its destination, the signal passes into layer1 and each block of data reaches the next highter layer,
